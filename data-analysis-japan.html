      <h1>Data Analytics – Visualization of my vacation spending</h1>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In 2018, I went to Japan for vacation with my friends Justin and Rebecca. While we were there, we kept track
          of all our expenditures, mainly for cost-splitting. It later turned out to be a nice dataset to visualize.</p>

        <p>For this project, I used R to clean the data and perform some simple visualizations; mainly because I was
          taking a course on R at the time. It took me around 3 days to complete.
        </p>

        <p>Here’s a link to the <a href="https://github.com/RobertYip/R-Visualization-Japan-Trip">GitHub</a> for the
          code including data cleaning. I purposely wrote in markdown format so that it is readable. After cleaning, we
          can proceed to the visualizations that summarizes the data.</p>

        <div class="img-center"><img src="img/DA01Raw-vs-Clean.png" class="article-img" alt="Splash image"></div>

        <p>The first chart is a simple bar chart, dividing the categorized expenses among each member. Spending is
          consistent among all 3 members, and we can see highest spending category is food followed by hotel.</p>
        <div class="img-center"><img src="img/DA02Bar.png" class="article-img"
            alt="Spending distribution in each category"></div>
        <p>The next chart shows that Rebecca spends the most money. Each “chunk” in a category also shows the size of
          the transaction. The small chunks illustrates many cheap transactions for food and the few large chunks
          illustrate expensive transactions for hotel.</p>
        <div class="img-center"><img src="img/DA03Chunk.png" class="article-img" alt="Who spent the most money"></div>
        <p>The final chart is a boxplot that shows the cost averages for each category. The box highlights the
          25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile. Hotel for example, cost on average 6000 yen but we also
          splurged 22000 yen for one!</p>

        <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
